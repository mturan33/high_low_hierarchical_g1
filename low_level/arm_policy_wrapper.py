"""
Stage 7 Arm Policy Wrapper
===========================
Loads the Stage 7 arm actor (right arm only, 55 obs -> 5 act)
and runs inference for the hierarchical control pipeline.

The arm actor was trained on the OLD 23-DoF G1 robot with these joint names:
  right_shoulder_pitch_joint, right_shoulder_roll_joint,
  right_shoulder_yaw_joint, right_elbow_pitch_joint, right_elbow_roll_joint

On the NEW 29-DoF G1+DEX3 robot, these map to:
  right_shoulder_pitch_joint  (same)
  right_shoulder_roll_joint   (same)
  right_shoulder_yaw_joint    (same)
  right_elbow_joint           (was: right_elbow_pitch_joint)
  right_wrist_roll_joint      (was: right_elbow_roll_joint)

The remaining wrist joints (wrist_pitch, wrist_yaw) are NOT controlled by
the policy and must be managed by the heuristic fallback.

Network: 55 -> [256, ELU, 256, ELU, 128, ELU] -> 5 (NO LayerNorm)
Action scale: 0.5  (target = default_arm + action * 0.5)
Default arm: ALL ZEROS (as trained on 23-DoF)

Checkpoint format (DualActorCritic):
  model_state_dict:
    arm_actor.net.0.weight  [256, 55]
    arm_actor.net.0.bias    [256]
